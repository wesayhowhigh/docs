# Working on Documentation

The Documentation System is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - a static site generator built using React and set up for TypeScript.

Most of the time, to update a document, you just need to edit or create a Markdown (`.md`) file. Touching React is entirely optional and not recommended without first consulting with the Lead Developer.



## Installation

- Clone the [Repository](https://github.com/wesayhowhigh/docs)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above
- Recommend you install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Check out a new branch `git checkout -b your-branch-name`



## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn run start
```
This will open up a development server on `http://localhost:3000/`

Any changes you make to the files inside /docs will trigger an automatic rebuild of the site and an automatic live update of the page in your browser!



## Creating a new Section

First you need to decide where your new piece of content belongs. Within **Development**, **Plugins** or **Websites**. If you think it doesn't belong in any of those, speak to the Lead Developer.

All Plugins should have a section created already inside `/plugins/LANGUAGE/PLUGIN_NAME`, unless this is a new Plugin.

Looking at the existing structure you should be able to see that a folder automatically creates a collapsible sidebar menu, with the MarkDown files inside, representing individual pages.

If you're creating a file for a `Plugin` you can base the structure on the Template file - located at `/docs/plugins/_template.md`.

You may also deduce that prefixing a file with an underscore prevents it from being included in the Frontend - so you can only find this template in the repository itself.



## Customising The Page

You are free to use all standard Markdown features. 

Docusaurus also comes with some very nice [extra Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) too.

You may notice at the top of the Markdown file, a section surrounded by dashes:

```markdown
---
slug: /
title: Hello world
sidebar_position: 1
---
```
These should be fairly self explanatory but most of the time you'll only need to worry about `sidebar_position`!

Inside a folder you may see a `_category.json` file with similar contents to this:

```json
{
  "label": "Troubleshooting",
  "position": 8
}
```

This is used to help the Auto Sidemenu Generation - See [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#category-item-metadata) for more information

 


## Assets

If you need any assets (such as images) to reference inside your Markdown, create an assets folder in the directory your document is and reference them relatively:

```markdown title="your-doc-file.md"
![Example banner](./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png)
```


For more detail see [Using Assets in Markdown](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets) on the Docusaurus site.




## Deployment

The JUMP Docs are hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Log in with our Jump Ops Github Account.

Vercel is a serverless deployment tool that automatically builds whenever the Github repository is updated.

### Staging

Once you've made your changes on your new local branch, simply push the branch to Github.

Vercel will **automatically pick up on this branch and build a brand new staging site for you to test!**

Log in to Vercel to see the URL for this site in the [Deployment section](https://vercel.com/wesayhowhigh/docs/deployments).

### Live

When you're happy, simply create a Pull Request to the master branch with the Lead Developer as a Reviewer.
